                  <p>Before it was established on 2 May 2017, members of the Research Team had joined in research exploring the motive of terror acts perpetrated by groups acting on behalf of Islam since 2007. This is due to the direction of the late Professor Sarlito W. Sarwono as the initiator of the psychology of terrorism in Indonesia who is also our teacher.</p>

            <p>This program targets terrorism convicts and their families. It includes a number of areas namely re-education, psychological counseling, both for individuals as well as for groups, as well as the debriefing of entrepreneurial skills. The participants are voluntarily invited, while the activities were presented in an informal dialogue. In addition, we also try increasing the participants' empathy so they are better able to interact with people from a different background. Furthermore, the entrepreneurship training provided skills to support their finances, which is especially useful once they are free. The program outside of the prison, on the other hand, is focused on visiting the families of terrorism convicts. During the visitation, the wives are given psychological counseling.</p>
