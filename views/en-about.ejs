                                    <p>This program targets terrorism convicts and their families. It includes a number of areas namely re-education, psychological counseling, both for individuals as well as for groups, as well as the debriefing of entrepreneurial skills. The participants are voluntarily invited, while the activities were presented in an informal dialogue. In addition, we also try increasing the participants' empathy so they are better able to interact with people from a different background. Furthermore, the entrepreneurship training provided skills to support their finances, which is especially useful once they are free. The program outside of the prison, on the other hand, is focused on visiting the families of terrorism convicts. During the visitation, the wives are given psychological counseling.</p>
